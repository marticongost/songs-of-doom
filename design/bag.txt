PROBABILITY COMPARISON: TARGET vs ACTUAL
-----------------------------------------

Skill 1:
  N≥1: Target 25%  → Actual 26.7%  (±1.7%)
  N≥2: Target 12%  → Actual 13.3%  (±1.3%)
  N≥3: Target 4%   → Actual 3.3%   (±0.7%)

Skill 2:
  N≥1: Target 40%  → Actual 40.0%  (EXACT!)
  N≥2: Target 20%  → Actual 20.0%  (EXACT!)
  N≥3: Target 6%   → Actual 6.7%   (±0.7%)

Skill 3:
  N≥1: Target 55%  → Actual 53.3%  (±1.7%)
  N≥2: Target 28%  → Actual 30.0%  (±2.0%)
  N≥3: Target 9%   → Actual 10.0%  (±1.0%)

Skill 4:
  N≥1: Target 70%  → Actual 70.0%  (EXACT!)
  N≥2: Target 40%  → Actual 40.0%  (EXACT!)
  N≥3: Target 13%  → Actual 13.3%  (±0.3%)

Skill 5:
  N≥1: Target 85%  → Actual 83.3%  (±1.7%)
  N≥2: Target 50%  → Actual 50.0%  (EXACT!)
  N≥3: Target 18%  → Actual 16.7%  (±1.3%)


MONOTONICITY CHECK:
-------------------
✓ N≥1: 26.7% → 40.0% → 53.3% → 70.0% → 83.3% (STRICTLY INCREASING)
✓ N≥2: 13.3% → 20.0% → 30.0% → 40.0% → 50.0% (STRICTLY INCREASING)
✓ N≥3:  3.3% →  6.7% → 10.0% → 13.3% → 16.7% (STRICTLY INCREASING)

Every skill level now has strictly better odds than the previous level
for all success thresholds. No more ties!


EXPECTED SUCCESSES BY SKILL LEVEL:
-----------------------------------
Skill 1: 0.433 average successes
Skill 2: 0.667 average successes
Skill 3: 0.933 average successes
Skill 4: 1.233 average successes
Skill 5: 1.500 average successes


KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
-----------------
- Fixed the S1-S3 tie at N≥3 (now: 3.3% → 6.7% → 10.0%)
- Maintained excellent fit to targets (5 exact matches!)
- All probability curves are now strictly monotonic increasing
- Maximum error on any probability: 2.0% (S3, N≥2)
- Average absolute error: 1.1%
- Skill 2 hits both N≥1 and N≥2 exactly!
- Skill 4 hits both N≥1 and N≥2 exactly!


DESIGN NOTES:
-------------
This composition ensures that investing in higher skill levels always
provides tangible benefits, with no breakpoints where two skill levels
have identical odds. The progression feels smooth and rewarding at every
step of character advancement.

The removal of N0 tokens from S1 (compared to previous version) helps
ensure lower-skilled characters have slightly worse odds for N≥3, while
adding some N0 tokens to S2-S5 helps fine-tune the probability curves.
